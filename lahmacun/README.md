## Recipe's Steps

### Step 1: prepare the dough

* in bowl just mix the flour, the water and the salt... until you have something
homogenous without any trace of water.
* at the end of your kneading, the dough should not be sticky anymore.

:information_source: If you have a kneading machine it's pretty simple, put
everything in the bowl and wait :D

* on a floury work surface, shape the dough as a big ball and store it in a
floury bowl.
* cover the bowl with a napkin and let the dough rest during the stuffing
preparation.

* process until you have something which looks like a mash.

* in a bowl with all the other ingredients transfer the mash and just mix!

### Step 3: preheat the oven

* 220Â°C

### Step 4: create the lahmacun

* split the dough in pieces of ~60-70g (~10 mini balls).
* spread the mini ball (by trying to keep a circle shape) as much as you can, the
dough should not be thick (around 2mm).
* spread the stuffing on it. The stuffing should cover all the dough

* put it in the oven for almost 5-6 minutes (on a floury plate!)
